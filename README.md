# Random Six Siege
This is my simple pet project created at the request of my friend for more fun gameplay in Rainbow Six siege.

The application is developed in Java using JavaFX 17.0.2. To run, you need at least Java version 17.

## How to start and update operators list?

Run OperatorDataLoader.exe in the same directory as Random Six Siege.exe. This file will automatically parse all the information from [the official Ubisoft website](https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/game/rainbow-six/siege/game-info/operators) and download it in directory. Run this file before you run the program, and use it to update operator list, when new operators will be added to the game and official site.
