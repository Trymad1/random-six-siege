# Random Six Siege
This is my simple pet project created at the request of my friend for more fun gameplay in Rainbow Six siege.

The application is developed in Java using JavaFX 17.0.2. To run, you need at least Java version 17.

## How to update operators list?

The LoadOperatorsData.py file is located in the src/ folder.
Run it and the script will automatically parse all the information from [the official Ubisoft website](https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/game/rainbow-six/siege/game-info/operators).

If you are not a developer, just download the jar file, I will update it every time a new operative is released,
or until I make an automatic update in the application
